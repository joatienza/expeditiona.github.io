-Collage design determined by 3-dimensional array called "<number of images>_images"
-Attempted to find a way to match each image to its best fit frame based on aspect ratio by sorting lots of arrays
	-Idea was scrapped, instead sorted image_list by aspect ratio by modifying a simple bubble sort algorithm found on the web
	-3-D design array elements rearranged so the lowest-aspect-ratio frames go first, making fitting job automatic
-Implemented code to resize images to fit into frames while maintaining original image's aspect ratio
-Implemented code creating new image file
-Pasted images into new image file
-Added designs for 1, 2, 3, and 5 images, as well as handling for 0 or >5 images
-Added logo
-Added rudimentary text formatting below collage
-Added design for 6 images
-Added text wrapping for caption, adjusting image size according to length of text
-Removed logo and code involving it
-Allowed text color to be customizable
-Finalized comments
